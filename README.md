# Comprehensive Data Analysis Project

## Part 1: Health Dataset Analysis and Coronary Heart Disease Prediction

### Introduction

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a health-related dataset, focusing on factors influencing coronary heart disease. The dataset consists of ten variables, each representing different aspects of patients' health and lifestyle. The analysis is conducted in several stages, including data classification, insights presentation, handling missing values, age analysis, data visualization, and the application of a logistic regression model for prediction.

### Project Stages

1. **Data Classification**
   - Categorize dataset columns into nominal, categorical, and continuous variables.

2. **Data Insights**
   - Identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data to gain valuable information about factors influencing patients' health.

3. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Identify and employ techniques to handle null values in each column.

4. **Age Analysis**
   - Explore the age variable, including finding the oldest and youngest individuals, determining average and median age groups, and understanding the relationship between age and deaths.

5. **Data Visualization**
   - Utilize techniques such as plotCorrelationMatrix, plotScatterMatrix, and plotPerColumnDistribution to visually represent data distributions.

6. **Logistic Regression Model**
   - Develop a logistic regression model for classification, training it using the dataset to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease.

### Project Goal

The primary goal is to understand the factors influencing coronary heart disease and develop a predictive model that could aid in early detection.

## Part 2: Real Estate Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling

### Introduction

This project report provides an in-depth analysis of a dataset containing information about real estate properties. The dataset is comprehensive, including both numerical and categorical features. The analysis covers tasks such as calculating summary statistics, analyzing the distribution of property prices, hypothesis testing on the impact of the year built on sale price, computing the covariance matrix, and building a linear regression model.

### Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure and composition.
   - Identify and categorize variables present in the dataset.

2. **Summary Statistics and Distribution Analysis**
   - Calculate summary statistics for numerical columns.
   - Analyze the distribution of the "price" feature using a histogram.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Conduct t-test and ANOVA to examine the impact of the year a property was built on its sale price.

4. **Covariance Matrix and Heatmap**
   - Compute the covariance matrix for numerical features and create a heatmap for visual representation.

5. **Advanced Mathematical Concepts**
   - Compute eigenvalue, eigenvector, and rank of the covariance matrix.
   - Calculate the inverse of the covariance matrix and discuss its impact on linear regression.

6. **Linear Regression Modeling**
   - Build a linear regression model using selected features from the dataset.

### Project Conclusion

The report combines statistical analysis with machine learning techniques to provide meaningful insights into real estate data, aiming to guide decision-making in real estate investments.

### Overall Conclusion

This project encompasses two parts: Health Dataset Analysis and Real Estate Data Analysis. Each part involves a thorough examination of the respective datasets, employing statistical methods and machine learning techniques to derive valuable insights. The ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing coronary heart disease and property prices, contributing to informed decision-making in healthcare and real estate investments.
